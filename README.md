# Memory Matching Game
- [memory matching game script](./Memory_Game.java)

## Background
- This was a project that I created for my COMP 284 Intro to Java class during Fall 2019
- This is my true first project created in Java 
- This is a text-based version of the game

## Explaination of Game
- The game works like a tile memory matching game where the user selects a tile from a grid of hidden tiles
- The tile then reveals a word and the user must find the corresponding tile that has the same word as the first tile selected
- If the second tile selected matches with the first, the matching pair is revealed and the user must continue the game by 
finding all matching pairs
- If the second tile selected does not match with the first, both tiles are then hidden again
- The goal of the game is to find all matching pairs(which are hidden) and this is when the program will end

## Future Directions
- Create a better user interface
- Make gameplay run more smoothly
- Figure out a better way to display grid that does not include the text breaking
- Divide up source code files?
