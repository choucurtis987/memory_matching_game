# Memory Matching Game (under construction)
- this was a project that I created for my Comp 284 Intro to Java class
- this is my true first project created in Java 
- the backend of the game works well but I do need some help improving user interface and making backend more "clean"

### Explaination of Game
- the game works like a tile memory matching game where the user selects a tile from a grid of hidden tiles
- the tile then reveals a word and the user must find the corresponding tile that has the same word as the first tile selected
- if the second tile selected matches with the first, the matching pair is revealed and the user must continue the game by 
finding all matching pairs
- if the second tile selected does not match with the first, both tiles are then hidden again
- the goal of the game is to find all matching pairs(which are hidden)
